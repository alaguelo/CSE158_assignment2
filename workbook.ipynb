    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "Source: https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#twitch <br>\n",
    "Basic Properties <br>\n",
    "> The raw data is Twitch metadata. The columns of the data include a Twitch user's ID, a stream ID, the streamer's username, time start, and time stop. Time start and time stop are in increments of 10 minutes, representing how long a user watches that specific stream/streamer. So, each row of data accounts for a specific Twitch user and an instance of them watching a stream. The full dataset has 15.5M data points. For the purposes of this project, we will be using the subset of 100k users in our model/training/exploration. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Predictive Task\n",
    "> Our task we chose is to predict whether a user will watch a specific streamer. Models that would be appropriate for this task include logistic regression or latent factor models like factorization machines, temporal based latent factor models, and sequential recommendation models. Since our dataset includes users and \"item consumption\" through the streamers they watch, we can also form relevant user and item/streamer features. These features can be used to describe user behaviors/history, and in the inverse sense streamer metrics/history. Time is also an important feature that can be used to better map user behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Metrics and Model Prediction Validity\n",
    "> To evaluate our model, we will split our data into a training and test set. We will also need to create an evaluation file to predict on. This file will help us evaluate our model. Becuase our data is only made up of \"positive\" instances where the user watches a streamer, the evaluation file will be a mix of data from the test set and negative samples. Negative samples would be a user never watching a certain streamer. Evaluating in this way will allow us to measure the accuracy of our model, letting us view true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. It ensures our model is actually recommending smartly, and not just looking for positive/watched instances. \n",
